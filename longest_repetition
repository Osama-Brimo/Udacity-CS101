# Question 8: Longest Repetition

# Define a procedure, longest_repetition, that takes as input a 
# list, and returns the element in the list that has the most 
# consecutive repetitions. If there are multiple elements that 
# have the same number of longest repetitions, the result should 
# be the one that appears first. If the input list is empty, 
# it should return None.

#For example,

print longest_repetition([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1])
# 3

print longest_repetition(['a', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'd', 'd'])
# b

print longest_repetition([[1], [2, 2], [2, 2], [2, 2], [3, 3, 3]])
# 1

print longest_repetition([])
# None
